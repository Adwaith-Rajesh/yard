### Yep Its another In-Memory Datastore.

---

### Why?

- Why Not?
- I am bored (A common theme in all of the projects I do)
- “What I cannot create, I do not understand” - _Richard Feynman_

Just wanted to learn how Redis worked, and I've never done any networking in C. So decided to build
a Redis type thingy. And I also wanted to test my memory management skills.
Let's see how much memory I can leak. :)

### Features

Not decided yet, I don't even know whether I'll complete this project, hopefully, I will.

Some of the features that I've thought of so far, are

- get, set, delete, ... usual Redis things
- Multiple Hashmaps
- Lists (Multiple types ... I've no clue how I'm gonna implement this)
- Take snapshots (basically a way of saving what the Datastore looks like at a given time)
- Vector Search (highly maybe, mainly bcoz it's C, and I'm a human being)

In the name you might've noticed the word **"RAPID"**. I'm not going to guarantee that, Well it's C
so it might just happen. The only reason it exists is that I can name my project **YARD**.

### Why name it YARD?

Good Question.

Whenever someone makes a new version of something, they just name it "Yet another something" I just followed that convention.

You can also say that it's a spin-off of [**YARN**](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html), which has nothing to do with datastore, but it just sounds similar :).

Follow the project if you are interested to see where it might reach.
that's it.

### Bye.....
